LinkedIn Scrapper

# Handling Infinite Scrolling with Selenium
One of the challenges when scraping LinkedIn job postings is that the website uses infinite scrolling. This means that as you scroll down the page, more job postings are loaded dynamically without changing the URL. To handle this, we'll be using Selenium, a web automation tool that allows us to control a web browser programmatically.

Use Selenium's find_elements_by_css_selector() method to find all the job posting elements on the page:

Extracting Job Details from the Sidebar

extracting the job data using BeautifulSoup or other parsing techniques.
When clicking on a job posting on LinkedIn, additional details about the job are displayed in a sidebar. To extract this information, will need to click on each job posting and scrape the data from the sidebar.

 Within the loop, we can use BeautifulSoup or other parsing techniques to extract the desired job details from the sidebar, such as job title, company name, location, salary range, and job description.

 We'll be using the `requests` library to send HTTP requests and the `BeautifulSoup` library to parse the HTML responses.

 # Saving the data to a file or database: 
 can use libraries like pandas or csv to save the data to a CSV file, or use a database library like sqlite3 or pymongo to store the data in a database.
